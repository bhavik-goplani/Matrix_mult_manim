# Cannon's & Fox's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm Animation

This project provides an animation of Cannon's and Fox's distributed memory matrix multiplication algorithms using [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), a powerful tool for creating animations for teaching mathematics.

## Usage

See `fox.py` for Fox's algorithm animation code
See `cannon.py` for Cannon's algorithm animation code

## Videos

You can also watch the animations on YouTube:
